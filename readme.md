A company intend to build underground transportation tunnels in New York city. How big should stations be? How far should this stations be? what should be the expected growth of passengers in the the future?  

This analysis is to give insights to passenger behavior and crouding from station to station in order to determine how big stations should be and if possible build more or less stations to ensure efficient way of travel.

This analysis is primary to be benefitial to the company developing this transportation system (high speed tunnel)

In this analysis, I plan to use the MTA dataset which contains almost all the useful information needed for this project, which includes the amount of passengers at various times of the day moving through various stations in different regions.
